# Hero Images Folder

This is the folder where you should upload your custom hero images.

1.  **Drag and drop** your image files into this folder (`public/assets/`).
2.  **Rename** them to match the filenames expected by `components/Hero.tsx`:
    *   `hero-1.jpg`
    *   `hero-2.jpg`
    *   `hero-3.jpg`
    *   `hero-4.jpg`

*Note: If your images use a different file extension (like .png), remember to update the filenames in `components/Hero.tsx`.*
